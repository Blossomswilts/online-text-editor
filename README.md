## Description
Using this application, you can create and edit text files. You can also download the application and use it offline. Any changes you make will be saved to the database and updated when you go back online. This application is able to do this by using IndexedDB, which is a way for browsers to store data locally. This application also uses a service worker, which is a script that runs in the background and manages caching for an application. Webpack configurations are also used to bundle the application for production. This application is deployed on Heroku, and you can access it through this link: [Online / Offline Text Editor](https://online-text-editor-9f097097b33f.herokuapp.com/)
